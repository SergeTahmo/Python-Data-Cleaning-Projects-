## 📊 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – (Kaggle)

This project focuses on preparing the dataset—sourced from Kaggle—for downstream data analysis or machine learning workflows. The dataset initially contains inconsistencies typical of real-world data, such as missing values, duplicates, mixed data types, and outliers.

### 🎯 Objective

To clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure:
- High data quality and consistency
- Accurate modeling inputs
- Reliable visual analysis and reporting

### 🧼 Cleaning Steps

1. **Initial Inspection**
   - Summary of null values, column data types, row counts

2. **Missing Values**
   - Strategy: Drop, fill (mean, median, mode), or label missing entries
   - Example: Filled `Age` with median; replaced `NaN` in `Category` with `"Unknown"`

3. **Duplicate Records**
   - Identified and removed duplicate rows to maintain dataset integrity

4. **Data Type Fixes**
   - Converted date fields to `datetime` format
   - Ensured numeric and categorical types were appropriately set

5. **Outlier Detection**
   - Identified outliers using the Z-score or IQR method
   - Outliers optionally flagged or removed

6. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted useful features like year/month/week from dates
   - Created binary flags, ratios, or group aggregates where useful

7. **Export**
   - Saved the cleaned dataset as `*_cleaned.csv` for analysis or modeling

### 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data wrangling
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `seaborn` / `matplotlib` for exploratory visualizations
  - Optional: `scikit-learn` for preprocessing if ML-related
